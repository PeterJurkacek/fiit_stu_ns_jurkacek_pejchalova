BEST PRACTICES WITH NOTEBOOKS
1. Follow a naming convention that shows the owner and the order the analysis was done in. We use the format 
<step>-<ghuser>-<description>.ipynb
napr. 
0.3-bull-visualize-distributions.ipynb

2. Refactor the good parts. Don't write code to do the same task in multiple notebooks. If it's a data preprocessing task, put it in the pipeline at src/data/make_dataset.py and load data from data/interim. If it's useful utility code, refactor it to src.
